Generate combined rankings that merge artifact authorship with AE committee

    Algorithm:
      1. **Index** AE members by normalised name (dedup by highest memberships).
      2. **Group** DBLP authors by normalised name.
      3. **Disambiguate** — when multiple DBLP authors share the same normalised
         name as an AE member (common for East-Asian names with DBLP suffixes),
         pick the best match via conference overlap:
         - If one candidate has strictly more overlapping conferences → winner.
         - If tied or no overlap → ambiguous; AE member appears standalone.
      4. **Walk authors** — for each DBLP author, attach AE data only if they
         are the designated winner for that normalised name. Merge years (max of
         both), merge conferences (union).
      5. **Walk unlinked AE members** — emit standalone entries for members not
         matched to any DBLP author.
      6. **Score** every entry via ``_build_entry`` (see scoring weights below),
         sort by combined_score descending, and assign dense ranks with ties.

    Returns a list of dicts sorted by combined_score descending.
